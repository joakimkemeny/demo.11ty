Ok, I admit. I have a thing for static site generators. It started with Jekyll; after that, Gatsby was my weapon of choice for a while. But new tools keep popping up every month, and my new favorite, without a doubt, is 11ty.

In the first article of my web development in 2022 series, I will show how I use 11ty to create this site.

Most web developers are probably familiar with static site generators by now. They are flexible and powerful tools to create websites that don't rely on databases, PHP runtimes, or even JavaScript. Instead, they generate plain HTML, CSS, and images just like the web used to be. You can add JavaScript if needed, but the basic experience remains fast, secure, and almost maintenance-free.

But flexible tools can quickly become too complicated, and I feel that Gatsby suffered that fate. Every time I opened one of my Gatsby projects and updated its dependencies, something broke. And even though GraphQL (that Gatsby uses as its data layer) sounded like a cool idea at the time, it may be overkill for a static website.

So when I rebuilt this site, I switched to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev), and I haven't regretted it for a second. This article will guide you through my setup, starting with the simple pages. It is the first article in a series where I will also cover more complex pages, social media, performance, accessibility, and a list of other topics. I will not show you every possible way to do it; instead, I will show you how I've done it. If it suits you – great – if not, use it as a starting point.
